# Campus Website

**Campus Website** is a web-based version of the Campus platform, designed to unify academic, club, and housing resources into a single accessible system for students and the university community.

Built with the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), the platform ensures smooth, scalable, and dynamic interaction between users and educational resources.

## 📚 Project Overview

The goal of the Campus Website is to centralize information and services that students frequently need, such as:
- Academic notices
- Club activities and event updates
- Housing board for renting or offering spaces
- Access to class materials and notes

By bringing these resources together, the platform solves the disorganization and fragmentation in traditional university systems.
